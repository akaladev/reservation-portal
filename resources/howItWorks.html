<h3><em>How it works</em></h3>
<p>
  Each experience takes place in our 4D immersive dome. Did we mention
  this also acts as a giant ball pit? Yes, you read that right. Not only
  will you learn something educational and valuable but you will get to
  spend your 30 minute slot playing in a ball pit! Once your family has
  been briefed on the safety aspects of the dome you will be let in to
  explore. An introductory screen will guide you through the game process.
   Each activity has pre-selected "special" balls which your family must
  find in the ball pit in order to learn something. There are a lot of
  balls in there so you will have to work as a team to find what you are
  looking for! Once you've found the special ball, san the QR code into
  the reader at the front of the ball pit. This will bring up the
  educational aspect of the experience. After a set period of time, you
  will be probted to start looking for another special ball. This activity
   will repeat until the end of your 30 minute time slot. Each experience
  focuses on a specific educational topic, so be sure to come back and try
   out a different lesson!
